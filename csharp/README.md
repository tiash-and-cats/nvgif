# NVGIF C# demo

> [!TIP]
> As it uses WinForms, this demo must be run on Windows.  
> Also the `.csproj` given uses .NET 10, which you might not have. Adjust it to your needs.

To run the demo, do:
``` batch
dotnet run
```

It will run the demo and open a WinForms window which shows the demo file `images/example.nvg`.
